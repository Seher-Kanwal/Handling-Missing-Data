# Missing Data 

### Missing data in machine learning refers to the absence of a value or a set of values in a dataset. It can occur for a variety of reasons, such as:

- __Data entry errors__
  
  Missing values may occur due to human error during the data collection or entry process.

- __Non-response__
   
   Missing values may occur when a participant in a study chooses not to answer a question or fails to complete a survey.

- __Technical issues__
    
    Missing values may occur due to technical issues such as data corruption, storage issues, or software malfunctions.

Missing data can be a significant problem in machine learning as it can result in biased or less accurate models. Therefore, it is important to handle missing data appropriately before training a model. There are several techniques to handle missing data, including imputation, modeling, and deletion of observations or variables with missing values. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the analysis and the nature and amount of missing data.



## Ways of handling Missing Data

7 ways to handle missing values in the dataset:

1.  Deleting Rows with missing values
2.  Impute missing values for continuous variable
3.  Impute missing values for categorical variable
4.  Other Imputation Methods
5.  Using Algorithms that support missing values
6.  Prediction of missing values
7.  Imputation using Deep Learning Library â€” Datawig
